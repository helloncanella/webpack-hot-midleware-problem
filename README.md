#webpack-hot-middleware/client problem

I'm trying to use webpack:typescript package.

For unknown reasons I'm getting 

`
ERROR in multi main
Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'webpack-hot-middleware/client' in /home/hellon/Desktop/ok
 @ multi main
`

After some googles and trials, I didn't get anywhere.
